# Uniswap Aragon App

An Aragon app using the [Aragon Agent](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/tree/master/apps/agent) enabling a DAO to 
interact with the [Uniswap protocol](https://uniswap.io/). 

The current functionality allows multiple Uniswap exchanges to be enabled in the app. ETH can be swapped on these 
 exchanges in return for their corresponding tokens, and the tokens can be swapped for ETH. There isn't currently UI for
 enabling/disabling Uniswap token exchanges, but they can be enabled/disabled during initialization and by using the Aragon CLI.
